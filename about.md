# FakeGDMod

Do you want to be a moderator in geometry dash? <cy>WELL YOU CAN BE IT!</c>

FakeGDMod is made for fun, it doesn't really do anything other than pretend you're a real moderator

This contains the 3 different types of mods:

- **Moderator** ![moderator](frame:modBadge_01_001.png&scale:0.5)

This allows you to send levels and delete levels, in addition to having the moderator badge on your profile

- **Elder Moderator** ![eldermoderator](frame:modBadge_02_001.png&scale:0.5)

This is all of the above and you can additionally delete comments from other users both on the profile and on the levels, even those of the same <cr>RobTop</c>

- **Leaderboard Moderator** ![lbmoderator](frame:modBadge_03_001.png&scale:0.5)

This really doesn't do anything more than have the badge within the game, since all the management of the leaderboards is done externally to the game

## Thanks to
